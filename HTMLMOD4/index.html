        <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.</p> 
        <p>It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing <strong>Lorem Ipsum passages,</strong> and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
